So, here it shows the corresponding output to what is shown in the Challenge instructions

# Challenges 
Two challenges that I had run into while doing this assignment was that I think I am going wrong with printing the 
largest turnout to the terminal because that's what is missing from the above output. While my initial out is almost right
as shown above, it seems that I may have saved to the text file incorrectly because my final output in the terminal was as 
shown:

# Summary 

This would be helpful for any election, as it automatically generates the total number of votes, so we could easily tell who is the winner in a more efficient manner.
One way to modify the code, would be inserting a question function that would allow a user to type in what county they are looking for, and in return, it would 
provide the whole output in regard to percentage and count. Another way to modify the code which would also coincide with the first way, is being able to type in 
any county nationwide, to see the different the outcomes if used for research purposes for example.
